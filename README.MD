# Personal Investment Tracker

This is a personal investment tracker designed to be used through the command line. It works alongside CSV files to input data, which is then converted into a Sqlite database and stored at a specified location. Its features include:

- Retrieval of market prices and exchange rates for defined securities and currencies from Yahoo Finance.
- Rebalancing of assets such as credit card debts, emergency funds, and stock/ETF allocations.
- Calculations for adjusted cost base and capital gain/loss.
- Double-entry accounting for every manually entered transaction (which can be quite involved).

As this utility is intended solely for personal use, I have not provided documentation on how to use it. Essentially, this serves as "open core" code for others to examine my programming skills.
