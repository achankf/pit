# Personal Investment Tracker

This is a personal investment tracker designed to be used through the command line. It works alongside CSV files to input data, which is then converted into a Sqlite database and stored at a specified location. Its features include:

- Rebalancing of assets such as credit card debts, emergency funds, and stock/ETF allocations.
- Calculations for adjusted cost base and capital gain/loss.
- Double-entry accounting for every manually entered transaction (which can be quite involved).

As this utility is intended solely for personal use, I have not provided documentation on how to use it. Essentially, this serves as "open core" code for others to examine my programming skills.

## Other Useful Spreadsheet Calculators

In addition to the Personal Investment Tracker, there are other useful spreadsheet calculators available, such as:

- A calculator for determining how to spend PC Optimum points when buying PC and NoName potato chips. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkEStQ_mmbwwfdCZcBWk7XxWgohS2xFnfqMb5tRK7Mc/edit?usp=sharing).
